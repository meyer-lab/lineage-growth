    "abstract": "Rapid antibody production in response to invading pathogens requires the dramatic expansion of pathogen-derived antigen-specific B lymphocyte populations. Whether B cell population dynamics are based on stochastic competition between competing cell fates, as in the development of competence by the bacterium , or on deterministic cell fate decisions that execute a predictable program, as during the development of the worm , remains unclear. Here, we developed long-term live-cell microscopy of B cell population expansion and multiscale mechanistic computational modeling to characterize the role of molecular noise in determining phenotype heterogeneity. We show that the cell lineage trees underlying B cell population dynamics are mediated by a largely predictable decision-making process where the heterogeneity of cell proliferation and death decisions at any given timepoint largely derives from nongenetic heterogeneity in the founder cells. This means that contrary to previous models, only a minority of genetically identical founder cells contribute the majority to the population response. We computationally predict and experimentally confirm nongenetic molecular determinants that are predictive of founder cells’ proliferative capacity. While founder cell heterogeneity may arise from different exposure histories, we show that it may also be due to the gradual accumulation of small amounts of intrinsic noise during the lineage differentiation process of hematopoietic stem cells to mature B cells. Our finding of the largely deterministic nature of B lymphocyte responses may provide opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cell proliferation is controlled by mitogens. However, how proliferation is coordinated with cell growth is poorly understood. Here we show that statistical properties of cell lineage trees – the cell-cycle length correlations within and across generations – reveal how cell growth controls proliferation. Analyzing extended lineage trees with latent-variable models, we find that two antagonistic heritable variables account for the observed cycle-length correlations. Using molecular perturbations of mTOR and MYC we identify these variables as cell size and regulatory license to divide, which are coupled through a minimum-size checkpoint. The checkpoint is relevant only for fast cell cycles, explaining why growth control of mammalian cell proliferation has remained elusive. Thus, correlated fluctuations of the cell cycle encode its regulation.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variability in a population of cells can work as the bet-hedging of the cells under an unpredictably changing environment, the typical example of which is the bacterial persistence. To understand the strategy to control such phenomena, it is indispensable to identify the phenotype of each cell and its inheritance. Although recent advancements in microfluidic technology offer us useful lineage data, they are insufficient to directly identify the phenotypes of the cells. An alternative approach is to infer the phenotype from the lineage data by latent-variable estimation. To this end, however, we must resolve the bias problem in the inference from lineage called survivorship bias. In this work, we clarify how the survivor bias distorts statistical estimations. We then propose a latent-variable estimation algorithm without the survivorship bias from lineage trees based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which we call Lineage EM algorithm (LEM). LEM provides a statistical method to identify the traits of the cells applicable to various kinds of lineage data.",

    "abstract": "Although genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of risk loci for complex traits, only a handful of the biologically causal variants, responsible for association at these loci, have been successfully identified. Current statistical methods for identifying causal variants at risk loci either use the strength of the association signal in an iterative conditioning framework or estimate probabilities for variants to be causal. A main drawback of existing methods is that they rely on the simplifying assumption of a single causal variant at each risk locus, which is typically invalid at many risk loci. In this work, we propose a new statistical framework that allows for the possibility of an arbitrary number of causal variants when estimating the posterior probability of a variant being causal. A direct benefit of our approach is that we predict a set of variants for each locus that under reasonable assumptions will contain all of the true causal variants with a high confidence level (e.g., 95%) even when the locus contains multiple causal variants. We use simulations to show that our approach provides 20–50% improvement in our ability to identify the causal variants compared to the existing methods at loci harboring multiple causal variants. We validate our approach using empirical data from an expression QTL study of CHI3L2 to identify new causal variants that affect gene expression at this locus.

    "abstract": "Cell heterogeneity may be caused by stochastic or deterministic effects. The inheritance of regulators through cell division is a key deterministic force, but identifying inheritance effects in a systematic manner has been challenging. Here, we measure and analyze cell cycles in deep lineage trees of human cancer cells and mouse embryonic stem cells and develop a statistical framework to infer underlying rules of inheritance. The observed long-range intra-generational correlations in cell-cycle duration, up to second cousins, seem paradoxical because ancestral correlations decay rapidly. However, this correlation pattern is naturally explained by the inheritance of both cell size and cell-cycle speed over several generations, provided that cell growth and division are coupled through a minimum-size checkpoint. This model correctly predicts the effects of inhibiting cell growth or cycle progression. In sum, we show how fluctuations of cell cycles across lineage trees help in understanding the coordination of cell growth and division.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new image texture segmentation algorithm, HMTseg, based on wavelets and the hidden Markov tree (HMT) model. The HMT is a tree-structured probabilistic graph that captures the statistical properties of the coefficients of the wavelet transform. Since the HMT is particularly well suited to images containing singularities (edges and ridges), it provides a good classifier for distinguishing between textures. Utilizing the inherent tree structure of the wavelet HMT and its fast training and likelihood computation algorithms, we perform texture classification at a range of different scales. We then fuse these multiscale classifications using a Bayesian probabilistic graph to obtain reliable final segmentations. Since HMTseg works on the wavelet transform of the image, it can directly segment wavelet-compressed images without the need for decompression into the space domain. We demonstrate the performance of HMTseg with synthetic, aerial photo, and document image segmentations.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence implicates heterogeneity within cancer cell populations in the response to stressful exposures, including drug treatments. While modeling the acute response to various anticancer agents in drug-sensitive human tumor cell lines, we consistently detected a small subpopulation of reversibly \"drug-tolerant\" cells. These cells demonstrate >100-fold reduced drug sensitivity and maintain viability via engagement of IGF-1 receptor signaling and an altered chromatin state that requires the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A. This drug-tolerant phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished at low frequency by individual cells within the population, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in drug tolerance. The drug-tolerant subpopulation can be selectively ablated by treatment with IGF-1 receptor inhibitors or chromatin-modifying agents, potentially yielding a therapeutic opportunity. Together, these findings suggest that cancer cell populations employ a dynamic survival strategy in which individual cells transiently assume a reversibly drug-tolerant state to protect the population from eradication by potentially lethal exposures.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis, the dissemination and growth of neoplastic cells in an organ distinct from that in which they originated, is the most common cause of death in cancer patients. This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter. These data provide novel insights into the genetic features underlying pancreatic cancer progression and define a broad time window of opportunity for early detection to prevent deaths from metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.",

    "abstract": "We present an integrated method that uses extended time-lapse automated imaging to quantify the dynamics of cell proliferation. Cell counts are fit with a quiescence-growth model that estimates rates of cell division, entry into quiescence and death. The model is constrained with rates extracted experimentally from the behavior of tracked single cells over time. We visualize the output of the analysis in fractional proliferation graphs, which deconvolve dynamic proliferative responses to perturbations into the relative contributions of dividing, quiescent (nondividing) and dead cells. The method reveals that the response of 'oncogene-addicted' human cancer cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a composite of altered rates of division, death and entry into quiescence, a finding that challenges the notion that such cells simply die in response to oncogene-targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "The problem of reconstruction of ancestral states given a phylogeny and data from extant species arises in a wide range of biological studies. The continuous-time Markov model for the discrete states evolution is generally used for the reconstruction of ancestral states. We modify this model to account for a case when the states of the extant species are uncertain. This situation appears, for example, if the states for extant species are predicted by some program and thus are known only with some level of reliability; it is common for bioinformatics field. The main idea is formulation of the problem as a hidden Markov model on a tree (tree HMM, tHMM), where the basic continuous-time Markov model is expanded with the introduction of emission probabilities of observed data (e.g. prediction scores) for each underlying discrete state. Our tHMM decoding algorithm allows us to predict states at the ancestral nodes as well as to refine states at the leaves on the basis of quantitative comparative genomics. The test on the simulated data shows that the tHMM approach applied to the continuous variable reflecting the probabilities of the states (i.e. prediction score) appears to be more accurate then the reconstruction from the discrete states assignment defined by the best score threshold. We provide examples of applying our model to the evolutionary analysis of N-terminal signal peptides and transcription factor binding sites in bacteria.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic aberrations, which are recognized as key drivers of several human diseases, are often caused by genetic defects that result in functional deregulation of epigenetic proteins, their altered expression and/or their atypical recruitment to certain gene promoters. Importantly, epigenetic changes are reversible, and epigenetic enzymes and regulatory proteins can be targeted using small molecules. This Review discusses the role of altered expression and/or function of one class of epigenetic regulators--histone deacetylases (HDACs)--and their role in cancer, neurological diseases and immune disorders. We highlight the development of small-molecule HDAC inhibitors and their use in the laboratory, in preclinical models and in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Tumors exhibit genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which has prognostic significance and may influence response to therapy. Imaging can quantify the spatial variation in architecture and function of individual tumors through quantifying basic biophysical parameters such as CT density or MRI signal relaxation rate; through measurements of blood flow, hypoxia, metabolism, cell death, and other phenotypic features; and through mapping the spatial distribution of biochemical pathways and cell signaling networks using PET, MRI, and other emerging molecular imaging techniques. These methods can establish whether one tumor is more or less heterogeneous than another and can identify subregions with differing biology. In this article, we review the image analysis methods currently used to quantify spatial heterogeneity within tumors. We discuss how analysis of intratumor heterogeneity can provide benefit over more simple biomarkers such as tumor size and average function. We consider how imaging methods can be integrated with genomic and pathology data, instead of being developed in isolation. Finally, we identify the challenges that must be overcome before measurements of intratumoral heterogeneity can be used routinely to guide patient care.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the multiple dysregulated oncoproteins that contribute to tumorigenesis in a given patient is crucial for developing personalized treatment plans. However, accurate inference of aberrant protein activity in biological samples is still challenging as genetic alterations are only partially predictive and direct measurements of protein activity are generally not feasible. To address this problem we introduce and experimentally validate a new algorithm, virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis (VIPER), for accurate assessment of protein activity from gene expression data. We used VIPER to evaluate the functional relevance of genetic alterations in regulatory proteins across all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that VIPER-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Therapies that target signalling molecules that are mutated in cancers can often have substantial short-term effects, but the emergence of resistant cancer cells is a major barrier to full cures. Resistance can result from secondary mutations, but in other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show that human melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves infrequent, semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug then induces epigenetic reprogramming in these cells, converting the transient transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signalling pathways, partially mediated by the activity of the transcription factors JUN and/or AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics in single cells. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic expression of many of these same marker genes, suggesting the existence of a general program in which expression is displayed in rare subpopulations of cells.",

    "abstract": "The goal of cancer chemotherapy is to induce homogeneous cell death within the population of targeted cancer cells. However, no two cells are exactly alike at the molecular level, and sensitivity to drug-induced cell death, therefore, varies within a population. Genetic alterations can contribute to this variability and lead to selection for drug resistant clones. However, there is a growing appreciation for the role of non-genetic variation in producing drug-tolerant cellular states that exhibit reduced sensitivity to cell death for extended periods of time, from hours to weeks. These cellular states may result from individual variation in epigenetics, gene expression, metabolism, and other processes that impact drug mechanism of action or the execution of cell death. Such population-level non-genetic heterogeneity may contribute to treatment failure and provide a cellular \"substrate\" for the emergence of genetic alterations that confer frank drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "We report the development of high-speed live-cell interferometry (HSLCI), a new multisample, multidrug testing platform for directly measuring tumor therapy response via real-time optical cell biomass measurements. As a proof of concept, we show that HSLCI rapidly profiles changes in biomass in BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-sensitive parental melanoma cell lines and in their isogenic BRAFi-resistant sublines. We show reproducible results from two different HSLCI platforms at two institutions that generate biomass kinetic signatures capable of discriminating between BRAFi-sensitive and -resistant melanoma cells within 24 h. Like other quantitative phase imaging (QPI) modalities, HSLCI is well-suited to noninvasive measurements of single cells and cell clusters, requiring no fluorescence or dye labeling. HSLCI is substantially faster and more sensitive than field-standard growth inhibition assays, and in terms of the number of cells measured simultaneously, the number of drugs tested in parallel, and temporal measurement range, it exceeds the state of the art by more than 10-fold. The accuracy and speed of HSLCI in profiling tumor cell heterogeneity and therapy resistance are promising features of potential tools to guide patient therapeutic selections.",

    "abstract": "A study was made of the relation between tumor doubling time and prognosis in lung cancer patients. Tumor doubling time was calculated in 237 patients from two serial chest x-ray films. The mean doubling time was 166.3 days, with 221.6 days for adenocarcinoma, 115.2 days for squamous cell carcinoma, 67.5 days for large cell carcinoma, 86.3 days for small cell carcinoma and 225.2 days for others. The patients were divided into three groups in a log-normal distribution of tumor doubling times 109.6 and 252.4 days. The patients with a doubling time of less than 109.6 days were classified as 'rapid growing', those with a doubling time of more than 252.4 days as 'slow growing' and those with a doubling time in between as 'intermediate growing'. The five-year survival rates were 23.3% for 81 'rapid growing' patients, 36.7% for 81 'intermediate growing' patients and 43.3% for 75 'slow growing' patients, with statistically significant differences between groups 'rapid growing' and 'intermediate growing' of P < 0.05 and between groups 'rapid growing' and 'slow growing' of P < 0.01. The five-year survival curves for those who underwent curable resections were 42.4% for 36 rapid growing patients, 53.7% for 31 'intermediate growing' patients and 70.1% for 43 'slow growing' patients. The difference between rapidly growing and slowly growing tumors was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Patients with the more rapidly growing tumors showed a tendency to have a poorer prognosis. It was confirmed that the doubling time of a tumor is an independent factor in the prognosis of lung cancer patients.",
